You,I am feeling anxious 
CalmBot,"I understand you're feeling anxious.  The text I have access to provides some coping strategies, such as deep breathing exercises (inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 6) and suggests seeking help from a qualified healthcare provider or using crisis hotlines.  For crisis hotlines, in the US you can dial or text 988, and in the UK you can call 111 (NHS) or 116 123 (Samaritans).  Remember that anxiety is a common and treatable condition."
