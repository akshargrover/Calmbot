You,"According to the document on coping strategies, whatâ€™s recommended during high stress?"
CalmBot,"The document recommends several strategies for managing high stress, categorized into problem-focused coping (directly addressing the source of stress) and emotion-focused coping (managing the emotional response).  Specific examples include problem-solving, seeking information, relaxation techniques, and seeking support from others.  Additionally, it suggests limiting exposure to stressors, learning to say no, and prioritizing tasks.  Finally, the document notes that seeking professional help, such as therapy or medication, is also an option if self-help strategies are insufficient."
