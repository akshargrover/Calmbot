CalmBot is a compassionate mental health chatbot that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide supportive, empathetic, and informative responses based on curated mental health documents. It leverages Google Gemini and LangChain for natural language understanding and document retrieval.

## Features
- Answers mental health questions using a curated set of PDF documents
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for context-aware responses
- Empathetic, supportive, and non-diagnostic tone
- Quick prompt buttons for common concerns (anxiety, sleep, focus, sadness)
- Option to show document sources for transparency
- Chat history is saved to a CSV file

## Requirements
- Python 3.10
- Google API Key (for Gemini)
- LangChain, Streamlit, and other dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd Calmbot
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following:
     ```env
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
     LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langchain_api_key_here
     ```
4. **Add your mental health documents:**
